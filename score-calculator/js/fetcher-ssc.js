   MOCK MATRIX HUB · SCORE CALCULATOR — fetcher-ssc.js  (v5 — reordered stagger + retry pass + summary)
   Fetches all parts (sections) of an SSC response sheet from
   sscexams.cbexams.com style URLs.

   WHY THIS CHANGED FROM v1: the old version fetched parts 1..10
   strictly SEQUENTIALLY (await in a for-loop), plus a 100ms sleep
   before each one — for a 5-section exam, that's 5 full network
   round-trips stacked back-to-back, easily 6-12+ seconds even on a
   decent connection. Since parser-ssc.js treats 1 part = 1 section,
   and each exam's exact section count is now maintained directly in
   exams-ssc.json's "parts" field, all parts are fetched IN PARALLEL,
   trusting that configured count completely — no extra probing beyond
   it, aside from the retry pass added in v4.

   Small stagger (STAGGER_MS) between each request's START (not its
   completion) is kept — firing every request in the exact same
   millisecond can look like a synchronized bot burst to some exam
   portals' protection; a small stagger avoids that while still being
   dramatically faster than fully sequential.

   WHAT'S NEW IN v5:
   - Fetch ORDER changed. Requests no longer fire 1, 2, 3, ... N in
     numeric order. Part 2 now fires FIRST (at 60ms, not 0ms), then
     parts 3, 4, ... N follow in order, and part 1 fires LAST. This
     is purely about which request hits the server first — total
     wall-clock time is unaffected since it's still bounded by the
     slowest single request.
   - Each in-flight promise is tagged with its real part number
     (via the `order` array + `partPromises` pairing) instead of
     relying on array position to imply part number. This matters
     BECAUSE the fetch order is no longer 1..N — using array index
     as the part number after reordering would silently mislabel
     responses (e.g. part 2's HTML saved as `p1`). Tagging keeps
     every response mapped to its correct `parts.pN` key regardless
     of what order it was requested in.

   WHAT'S IN v4 (unchanged):
   - Retry pass: any part that comes back empty/failed in the first
     parallel burst gets ONE retry — run alone, sequentially, after
     everything else has already settled, rather than bundled back
     into another simultaneous burst. Only helps TRANSIENT failures
     (server hiccup, brief rate limit) — a structurally wrong URL will
     fail identically on retry too.
   - Summary log: fetchAll() now logs "X/Y sections captured" once
     everything (including retries) has settled, so it's visible how
     many of the exam's known sections actually came through.
